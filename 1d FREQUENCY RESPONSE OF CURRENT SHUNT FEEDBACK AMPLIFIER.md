### **Result**

Thus the current shunt feedback amplifier is designed and constructed  and the following parameters are calculated.
| S.No | Parameters | Without Feedback | With Feedback |
|:----:|-------------|:----------------:|:--------------:|
| 1 | Lower cut-off frequency | = 29hz| =30hz |
| 2 | Upper cut-off frequency | = 250hz| =250 |
| 3 | Bandwidth | \( BW = 221hz) | \( BW = 220hz) |
| 4 | Mid-band Gain | \( A{v(mid)} = 13db) | \( A'{v(mid)} = 12.5) |
| 5 | Gain at half power point | 7.60 | 7.66 |

---

**Conclusion:**  
The frequency response of the current shunt feedback amplifier was studied. It was observed that the **gain decreases** while the **bandwidth increases** when negative feedback is applied, confirming the theoretical expectations.
